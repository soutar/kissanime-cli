# KissAnime CLI

Quick and dirty command-line interface for streaming anime from KissAnime. The CLI allows you to search by anime title and select any available episode. The episode you select will be opened in your default web browser.

* [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) - Awesome, friendly command-line UI.
* [KissAnime](http://kissanime.to/) - Somewhat questionable source of great anime
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) - Allowed me to write crazy lunatic code with async/await. See lines 71-73 in src/kissanime.js for the coolest async-masquerading-as-sync code ever.
